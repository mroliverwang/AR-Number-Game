# ARNumberGame

Ziqi Wang  Oct 12, 2023

Hello,

Here is some explanations of my work. First of all, I modified the required gameplay into more specific game mechanics.
In each round, a random number of apples will drop to an invisible platform. A voice over will encourage children to count 
the apples by counting with them. Then players will be required to select the correct number of apples from 4 different options.
Players can win the game by selecting 10 correct answers.

Some other development details:
- Fade in & out transition animations for buttons
- If players select the wrong answer, they can try again. 
  The same amount of apples will drop again but in a slower speed, for better educational purposes. 
- Number repetitions are avoided in the challenges.

In terms of the AR interactions, I found the game requirement is a bit general, so I was not sure which kind of interactions is required. 
More interactions could be developed including plane detections or virtual buttons, if more time was allowed.

I don't have an Android phone so I couldn't test the build. Sorry.

Thank you very much for your time reading my work and considering my application. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
